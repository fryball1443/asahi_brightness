# look at this current document. can i make it so that if they type chbr  -s 100, itll make the current script run, but instead of result=$(echo "scale=1; $1 / 100 * 400" | bc being the % out of 400, it does the % out of the value of /sys/class/backlight/apple-panel-bl/max_brightness

# Subsequently, if i type chbr -k 100, itll be the same calculations, but it does the % out of the value of /sys/devices/platform/led-controller/leds/kbd_backlight/max_brightness, and later will echo $result > $keybacklight_file
